# Interactive Journalism Feed
A Twitter bot that tweets new interactive, graphic, and data vis stories from newsrooms around the world. It works by scripts that are periodically ran that check APIs, RSS feeds, and sitemaps.

You can follow it at [@InteractiveFeed](https://twitter.com/InteractiveFeed).

## Requirements
- Node v14 or above
- NYT and Twitter credentials for `secrets.json`

## Missing Publications
Not all publications have specific feeds or repeatable url structures to get the types of stories we're looking to share. While this isn't a complete list of what's missing, here's some major newsrooms that we don't have hooked up.

WSJ, Reuters, LA Times, NPR, Vox, The Verge, SB Nation, ProPublica, USA Today, Axios, Marshall Project, National Geographic, Minnepolis Star Tribune, Miami Herald, Texas Tribune, The Atlantic, Boston Globe, New Yorker, CBC, Toronto Star, Al Jazeera, and many more.
